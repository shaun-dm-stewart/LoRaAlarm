# LoRa Alarm
This repository contains the source code for a basic radio alarm system using LoRa technology.  It consists of three elements.

## Remote Node
The remote node is a Heltec WiFi Lora V3.2 board.  It supports one digital input. In my case a passive infra red sensor and two digital outputs that can drive relays to operate say an audible alarm and a light.

## Hub
The hub is a Heltec V3.2 board that acts as a base station for the remote node.  It relays alarm signal and watchdog information between the remote node and the UI.

## UI
The UI is a Cheap Yellow Display that displays alarm status and allows the user to enable and disable the digital outputs at the remote node.

## Notes 
The UI is lvgl generated by the open source application EEZ Studio.  Eez Studio is by far the easiest way I have found to generate UIs in CYDs.
